;; "fun" with lists
;; While both functions behave correctly if the specified index is in bounds (0 â‰¤ index < list size), they return different values if the index is out of bounds. The latter simply returns an unchanged copy of the list. The former returns a bizarre list, with nils added at the end. Modify remove-nth-A so that it behaves the same as remove-nth-B (i.e., returns the unchanged list) when the index is out of bounds. 

(defn remove-nth-A [arblist n]

    arblist)) ;;returns the original list if index is out of bounds

(replace-nth '(:a :b :c :d) 2 :x)
(replace-nth '(:a :b :c :d) 9 :x)

;; Define a function named inc-nth that takes two inputs, a list of numbers and an index, and returns a copy of the list with the number at the specified index incremented. For example, (inc-nth '(10 20 30) 0) should return (11 20 30) . As before, it should return an unchanged copy of the list if the index is out of bounds. 

(defn inc-nth [arblist n]

;; "fun" with recursion
;; Define a function named dice-roll that has one input, the number of sides, and returns the sum of two die rolls with that number of sides each. For example, (dice-roll 8) would return the sum of two 8-sided dice.

(defn dice-roll [sides]
  (+ (inc (rand-int sides)) (inc (rand-int sides)))) ;; generates a random number between 1 and the number of sides, inclusive, for two dice and adds them together

(dice-roll 8)

;; Define a function named count-rolls that takes three inputs, all positive integers, representing a number of rolls, the number of die sides and a desired dice total. The function should repeatedly call the dice-roll function to simulate the specified number of rolls and return the number of times the desired total was obtained. For example, the call (count-rolls 1000 6 7) should simulate 1000 6-sided dice rolls and return the number of times 7 was rolled. Since the number of rolls could be large, your function should utilize tail-recursion. 

(defn count-rolls [num-rolls sides desired-total]
  (defn count-helper [rolls-left count-so-far] ;; helper function to keep track of rolls left and count of desired total
    (if (zero? rolls-left) ;; base case: if no rolls left, return count 
      count-so-far ;; return the count of desired total
      (let [roll (dice-roll sides)] ;; roll the dice, there has to be a let binding here since we need to use the roll in the next line idk how else to do it
        (if (= roll desired-total) ;; check if the roll matches the desired total
          (count-helper (dec rolls-left) (inc count-so-far)) ;; increment count if it matches
          (count-helper (dec rolls-left) count-so-far))))) ;; otherwise, just decrement rolls left

  (count-helper num-rolls 0)) ;; call the helper function with initial rolls and count, helps to keep track of the of the count so far 

(count-rolls 1000 6 7)

;; Define a function named count-all that takes two inputs, both positive integers, representing a number of rolls and the number of die sides. The function should repeatedly call the dice-roll function to simulate that many rolls and return a list with the counts for all dice totals. For example, the call (count-all 10000 6) might return (288 526 824 1093 1388 1708 1413 1115 811 563 271), signifying that 288 rolls totaled 2, 526 rolls totaled 3, 824 rolls totaled 4, etc. Since the number of rolls could be large, your function should utilize tail-recursion. Note: you should be able to make use of your inc-nth function here.
