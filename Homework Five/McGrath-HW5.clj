;; Define a function named count-rolls that takes three inputs, all positive integers, representing a number of rolls, the number of die sides and a desired dice total. The function should repeatedly call the dice-roll function to simulate the specified number of rolls and return the number of times the desired total was obtained. For example, the call (count-rolls 1000 6 7) should simulate 1000 6-sided dice rolls and return the number of times 7 was rolled.
